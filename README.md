sample-custom-url-scheme
========================

This sample application demonstrates the usage of custom URL schemes in iOS and Android. 
The scheme is defined as myapp://, so an uri starting with myapp:// would trigger it e.g. `<a href="myapp://views/navigate.html">Open App</a>`


For more information please refer to the [sample documentation](http://docs.icenium.com/sample-apps/sample-custom-url-schemes).
